## 2. Prepare
### 2.1. Data Source
The dataset used in this case study is **“FitBit Fitness Tracker Data”**. It is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. This dataset is stored in **Kaggle** and was made available through Mobius. The license of the dataset is “Public Domain”, so this data source is considered as an **open source**.

The datasource includes 17 .csv files in total. Of these, 15 datasets are in a long format. Additionally, 3 of these datasets are also available in a wide format, containing the same data as in their long-format counterparts.

### 2.2. Assessing Data Credibility (ROCC Framework)
**Reliable**
- *Evaluation*: This dataset, sourced from Mobius on Kaggle, is generally reliable but has limitations. Fitbit's accuracy in tracking heart rate and sleep stages may vary, and self-selection bias could skew results as data comes from only 30 consenting users, potentially more health-conscious than average. Additionally, the small sample size and two-month collection period limit its representation of Fitbit's broader user base.
- *Assessment*: **Low reliability** due to limited study group, self-selection bias and potential inaccuracies from device limitations.
**Original**
- *Evaluation*: The data is collected directly from Fitbit devices, ensuring originality since it captures raw, minute-level physical activity, heart rate, and sleep data from the users. Mobius has aggregated this data but is not the original collector (Fitbit is).
- *Assessment*: **High originality**, with minimal alterations from wearables to aggregation by Mobius.
**Comprehensive**
- *Evaluation*: The dataset provides minute-level data on activity, heart rate, and sleep over two months, offering detailed insights into short-term health trends. However, its two-month span and 30 participants limit long-term pattern analysis.
- *Assessment*: **Moderately comprehensive** due to high granularity but limited scope.
**Current**
- *Evaluation*: The data was collected in late 2016. While it provides a detailed snapshot, the age of the data (over seven years) means it may not reflect current health or activity trends and might lack newer data dimensions from updated Fitbit devices. Although it is updated annually and the last update is for 8 months ago.
- *Assessment*: **Low currency** due to the data source’s collection date.
**Cited**
- *Evaluation*: The dataset is hosted on Kaggle and attributed to Mobius, with data submission via Amazon Mechanical Turk. However, there may be limited peer-reviewed or third-party citations directly related to this specific dataset, which can impact citation credibility.
- *Assessment*: **Moderately cited**

## 3. Process
In the process phase of this case study, we focused on ensuring data integrity, conducting a thorough data cleaning process, and documenting each step to facilitate transparent, reproducible analysis.

### 3.1. Tools and Approach
We used Python and its libraries, specifically Pandas, for data cleaning and manipulation. Python was chosen for its robust data handling capabilities, which allowed for efficient handling of multiple datasets, transforming data, and verifying data integrity.
### 3.2. Steps Taken to Ensure Data Integrity and Cleanliness
The following steps were implemented to prepare the data for analysis.

**Loading and Initial Inspection of the Data**
The data consisted of 18 CSV files, which were inspected individually.
Using pd.read_csv, each dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for preliminary exploration, including checks for structural consistency across files.

**Removing Duplicates**
We removed any duplicate entries using drop_duplicates(), ensuring that each observation was unique and accurately represented.

**Handling Missing Values**
We assessed missing values across each column using isnull().sum(). This helped identify potential gaps in the data, and if it was necessary removed. The same process for NA values using df = df.dropna()

**Clean and Rename Columns**
All column names were converted to lowercase to maintain a uniform naming convention, making them easier to reference in a case-insensitive environment and improving readability.
By standardizing column names using df.columns = df.columns.str.lower(), we reduced the risk of errors during analysis and ensured a cleaner dataset structure.

**Ensuring Unique Identifiers**
Unique user identifiers were crucial for analyzing trends and user behavior. We verified the uniqueness of IDs with df['Id'].nunique(), ensuring accurate representation of user activities without redundancies.

**Data Type Conversion**
Date and Time Conversion:
Columns representing dates and times, such as ActivityDate and ActivityTime, were converted to appropriate formats for ease of use in temporal analysis.
For ActivityDate, we used pd.to_datetime() to convert the format, handling errors with errors='coerce' to manage inconsistencies.
In the case of ActivityTime, which required a 12-hour AM/PM format, the same function was applied to standardize entries across datasets.

**Rounding Numerical Values**
In datasets containing numerical values with decimal points, specific columns were rounded to two decimal places using round(2). This step was essential to maintain precision while simplifying numerical comparisons.

**Saving Cleaned Datasets**
Each cleaned dataset was saved to a designated directory with a standardized naming convention for organized storage and easier future access. The cleaned files were saved as new CSV files using to_csv(), ensuring no modifications were made to the original data.

### 3.3. Challenges Faced
- Some heart rate data was too granular (minute-level intervals) and needed aggregation to hour-level intervals.
- Data for certain users was incomplete, limiting analysis.

## 4. Analyze

### Steps Taken
1. **Import Necessary Libraries**
First, import the essential Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib Pyplot) for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Load the Datasets**
Read the datasets into pandas DataFrames using pd.read_csv().
3. **Combine Datasets**
Our data is split into two groups:
Group 1: Contains records from the time period March 12, 2016 (03.12.2016) to April 11, 2016 (04.11.2016).
Group 2: Contains records from the time period April 12, 2016 (04.12.2016) to May 12, 2016 (05.12.2016).
Each group represents a different chunk of the overall dataset for the two months. However, to perform a comprehensive analysis covering the entire two-month period, we need to combine these datasets into a single DataFrame. This allows us to work with all the data at once without needing to repeatedly analyze each group separately.
To combine these two datasets for each type of data (e.g., daily activity, hourly calories), we used **pd.concat()**, a function provided by pandas. 
Here's why:
pd.concat() merges multiple DataFrames either row-wise or column-wise. In our case, we combine them row-wise (axis=0) to stack the data from Group 2 below Group 1.
This operation maintains the structure of the datasets, ensuring that all rows and columns are retained.
4. **Explore the Data**
- *Descriptive Statistics*: Use dataset_name.head() to view the first few rows, dataset_name.info() to check the structure, and dataset_name.describe() for a statistical summary of the dataset.
5. **Merge Datasets if Necessary**
To analyze data across different time granularities, combine datasets using a common key:
*Merge datasets on a common identifier*
merged_data = pd.merge(dataset1, dataset2, on='common_key')

*Merge datasets on multiple keys (e.g., ID and date)*
merged_data = pd.merge(dataset1, dataset2, on=['common_key', 'date_key'])
6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Investigated the relationship between total steps and calories burned, revealing a positive correlation.
- Analyzed hourly activity and calorie burn patterns to identify peak activity times (late afternoon to early evening).
- Segmented users based on activity levels and categorized them as sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, or very active.

7. **Visualization**
- Generated scatter plots to visualize relationships between activity intensity and calorie burn.
- Created bar charts to display average activity levels and calories burned by hour, day type (weekday vs. weekend), and user category.
- Illustrated sleep trends across weekdays and weekends, highlighting consistency gaps.

8. **Statistical Analysis**
- Computed averages, standard deviations, and activity level distributions to understand user behavior.
- Assessed user engagement trends by correlating daily steps with calories burned over time.
- Identified activity variances based on usage factors, such as weekday routines versus weekend relaxation.

9. **Findings Extraction**
- Extracted key patterns, such as high activity levels on Saturdays and calorie burn peaking in the late afternoon.
- Highlighted user groups (e.g., sedentary users) with potential for increased engagement through targeted campaigns.
- Emphasized opportunities to encourage consistent sleep patterns during weekdays and promote light activities on Sundays.
